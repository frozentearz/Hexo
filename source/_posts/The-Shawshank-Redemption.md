"The Shawshank Redemption" is absolutely a good film.

>Remember， Hope is a good thing， maybe the best of things， and no good thing ever dies.

"The Shawshank Redemption" reflects how precious "**Hope**" is to people, Especially in "**institutionalizing**". 
Indeed, with a small hammer, nearly 20 years, in the human body to control the fascist prison strictly, dug a small escape tunnel. That's Miracle! How did he do it?

Red is the strong man. and Andy is that great man. He wants not only to redeem himself but also to redeem others. "**Hope**" is the charm of Andy. That's the point why Andy can escape out. 
And "**institutionalizing**", it reflects the real society.

>These walls are kind of funny like that：First you hate them，then you get used to them，Enough time passed，get so you depend on them。That's institutionalizing.

The movie also has an institutionalized "fuck" who is Brooks Hatlen.

Yes, this guy. He has the freedom of the body, but his soul has long been strangled by the Shawshank. In the end, he had to choose to disappear from a world that was no longer his own. A pathetic guy.

The fact is, all of us are institutionalized by life, by society. So,
1. Keep hope in life
2. Be persevering
3. Be wise

Don't be defeated, Hope is in front of you.
